- Generates 200-character descriptions with comprehensive industry categorization
- Utilizes the latest web sources for current company data

### üõ°Ô∏è Robust Error Handling
- **Smart rate limiting:** 15 requests per minute with automatic 1-minute pauses
- **Retry mechanism:** Exponential backoff for failed requests (up to 3 attempts)
- **Request stability:** 2-second delay between requests to prevent throttling
- Detailed error logging and reporting

### üìä Comprehensive Output
- Organized results by country with clear headers
- Execution metadata (start time, end time, duration, model used)
- Sequential numbering for easy reference
- UTF-8 encoding for international company names

### ‚ö° Performance Optimized
- Processes ~100 companies in approximately 9 minutes
- Accurate ETA calculation based on request count
- Real-time progress tracking with company names
- Efficient sequential processing

---

## Configuration

Customize processing parameters in the `call_gemini_api_sequential()` function:
```python
sleep_after = 15        # Requests before rate limit pause
sleep_time = 60         # Rate limit pause duration (seconds)
request_delay = 2       # Delay between requests (seconds)
model = "gemini-2.5-flash-lite"  # Gemini model to use
max_retries = 3         # Maximum retry attempts
```

---

## Output Format

The script generates a detailed log file (`gemini_log.txt`) with the following structure:
```
